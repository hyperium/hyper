# Security Policy

hyper (and related projects in hyperium) take security seriously, and greatly appreciate responsibile disclosure.

## Report a security issue

To report a security issue in hyper, or another crate in the hyperium organization, please [report a new draft GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/security/advisories/new).

We will discuss it privately with you. hyper maintainers will determine the impact and release details. Participation in security issue coordination is at the discretion of hyper maintainers.

## Transparency

We are committed to transparency in the security issue disclosure process. Advisories will be disclosed publicly once a patch is released, and if appropriate, added to the RustSec advisory database.
