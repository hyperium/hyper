# Minimum Support Rust Version (MSRV)

hyper's current policy is to always support a Rust version at least 6 months
old. That is, a compiler version released within the last 6 months can compile
hyper. It is possible that an older compiler can work, but that is not
guaranteed. We try to increase the MSRV responsibly, only when a significant
new feature is needed.

The current MSRV is: **1.46**.
